## What is Bitburner?
Bitburner is a free and open source hacking game where the player can write Javascript code to continually increase his or her wealth, abilities, and stature through nefarious means. The link to the game source code is [here](https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner), and the link to the game's documentation is [here](https://bitburner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). You can [play it through your browser](https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/) (no login/registration required). Bitburner is also available [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/).

The game was originally developed by [danielyxie](https://github.com/danielyxie) and is currently maintained by [hydroflame](https://github.com/hydroflame).

There's even a [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bitburner.bitburner-vscode-integration) available for the game!

## Strategy
This repository is a place to document my strategy for playing this game, which I developed iteratively into the scripts contained herein. I don't claim absolute optimization, but these scripts did allow me to unlock nearly all of the main game achievements so far (i.e. achievements not related to [end-game bitnodes](https://bitburner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advancedgameplay/bitnodes.html?highlight=bitnode) and the achievements that don't require hacking the game itself). As I continue, I will likely cover the special cases introduced by Bitnodes in the future.

While there are multiple ways to engage in this game, I focus mainly on hacking, stocks, and hacknet nodes to get ahead, each of which has its own dedicated section:

- [Hacking](./hacking)
- [Stocks](./stocks)
- [Hacknet Nodes](./hacknet)

I also have a script for purchasing servers, which are used to assist with hacking:

- [Servers](./servers)
